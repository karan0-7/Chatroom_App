2) If the username already exists, the user is given a warning regarding the same and is asked to enter another username.
3) Chatting with all of the other users that are present in the current room.
4) The user can see who all the other Users are in the room by hovering over the "Who's Online" text.
5) The user can change their Username and profile picture
6) The user can join other rooms.
7) If some other users enter a room, the rest of the users will be informed regarding the same.
